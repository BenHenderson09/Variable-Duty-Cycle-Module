## Details
- 555 timer controls the cycle.
- Capacitor C1 can be changed to alter the frequency.
- 9VDC-35VDC input voltage (for logic, not powering the given component). 
- Duty cycle can be varied between 5% and 100%.
- All CAD files available [here.](https://github.com/BenHenderson09/Variable-Duty-Cycle-Module/tree/master/kicad)
